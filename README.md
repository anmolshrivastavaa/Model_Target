🔌 AR Switchboard Functionality Visualizer (Vuforia + Unity)

📖 Overview
This project is an **Augmented Reality (AR) application** built with **Vuforia Model Target Generator** and **Unity**, where a switchboard can be scanned in real-time to showcase its **functionalities**.  
The app overlays **arrows and text labels** on the recognized switchboard, making it easier for electricians, technicians, and learners to identify each component.


🚀 Features
- 📷 Photogrammetry Model Creation using Polycam.  
- 🎨 3D Model Refinement in Blender.  
- 🧠 Model Training in Vuforia MTG (guide view, dimensions, real-world appearance).  
- 🎮 Unity Integration with AR Camera and Model Target Database.  
- 📝 UI Overlays & Labels to explain switchboard functionalities.  
- 💻 C# Script ensures UI always faces the AR camera.  
- 📱 APK Build for Android for real-time testing.

📂 Project Workflow
1. **Capture Model** → Switchboard scanned with Polycam.  
2. **Refine Model** → Clean & optimize in Blender.  
3. **Train in Vuforia MTG** → Set dimensions, guide view, vectors.  
4. **Import to Unity** → Add AR Camera, Vuforia DB, Model Target.  
5. **Add UI Overlays** → Arrows & text labels for functionalities.  
6. **C# Script** → Ensure UI always faces AR Camera.  
7. **Build APK** → Deploy & test on Android.
